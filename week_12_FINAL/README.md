Concept Statement

My concept starts with a will to work with algorithmic animation and dance performance.

When watching dance videos on Vimeo I came across this one made by some guy in Montreal.

What I liked the most is that both the video director and the dancer were appropriating a song that did not belong to them to give shape to their art. Both dance movements and video cuts were based in the musical transitions.

I thought it could be a good idea to make another remix, as if it was possible to infinitely expand a work of art.

My final video uses ofxOpticalFlowFarneback, flowfields and particle systems. It works as an overlapping narrative of code over the original video, making back and forth transitions between the optical flow rendering, the particles moved by the flowfield generated, and custom image rendering from those particles.
