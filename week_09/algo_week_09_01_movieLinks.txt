This scene has at least 4 of them:

- Squash and stretch (in the bag)
- secondary action (All hanging things moving)
- Exaggeration (size of the bag)
- Appeal (isn't the character adorable?)

(May I add as a final comment that the 2D complex animated choreographies of Disney were an incredible work of scripting and directing. In Beauty and the Beast they present most of the movie's characters in 5 minutes, for instance. In the Alladin sequence, although the sequence is about Alladin himself, the main moving character is the genie).
